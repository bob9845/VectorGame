# ProcessingNewProject
A simple program which makes a fullscreen processing window.  Good for starting projects.

1. To Start, type into terminal:  
	`git clone https://github.com/RAHS-Computer-Science-Club/ProcessingNewProject.git`
2. Rename the root directory to whatever you like (The project name).  The name you choose is defined by "__RenamedProject__"   
	`mv ProcessingNewProject/` __`RenamedProject`__`/`
3. Then, cd into it:  
	`cd` __`RenamedProject`__`/`
4. Rename the project in the code:  
	`./rename.sh` __`RenamedProject`__
5. Test, to make sure it compiles:  
	`ant build`
6. Now you're all set to make a new project in processing!
